# TraceyPeaks_Automated
This is a modification of the Tracey Peaks Fitting program provided by R. Smith using Chi^2 minimisation program. This was written in MATLAB


Clone all the files in this repo, and put it into the Tracey_Peaker_V0_01_17 directory as provided from Canvas.
Not so sure if I have permission to upload the original Tracey Peaker program on GitHub, which is why there are only the files which have been
uploaded are those that I have personally modified.
